- It’s actually really easy to get through! For Task 1 all you do is take an assessment test that takes about 30 minutes to get through. You’ll wind up with five different personality traits and you just right about how all five traits you received in the assessment apply to you. (I personally didn’t read any of the course material, I just skipped that and jumped right into it and followed the exact direction of the rubric.
- Task 2 is going to be about a meeting and the things you observed during it. There’s going to be a video that’s about five minutes long. All you do is watch that, just like Task I once again answer the questions in the rubric and it’ll be an easy pass. Just try not to be super long-winded in your answers. If they’re asking you something for both Tasks just answer the questions right down to what they’re asking. No need to elaborate too much

  - It can be helpful to read chapter 6 for task 1 and chapter 7 for task 2.
  - Task 1 is more of a self-awareness activity and Task 2 is observing leadership in others during a meeting between two teams in conflict.

- create a smart goal on developing a leadership skill because of what they learned in the StrengthsFinder assessment.

## TASK 1: All about you!

1. Take the Clifton Strengths self-assessment. You can find the link to the assessment in the task details, scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see the link. It should only take about 20 minutes.

2. After you finish the assessment take a screenshot of the results. You should see your top five strengths. I recommend reviewing the Clifton Strengths material about the strengths to help you apply them and understand them better.

3. Write a SMART goal related to developing a Leadership Skill. You must use the acronym SMART and write one sentence for each of the letters.

4. Complete the entire template (See attached below). It has directions and support for each of the sections.

5. Proofread your task. Inspect your work for articulation errors and proper APA format. Use this APA Reference to assist. If additional help is needed with either articulation or APA format, use Grammarly, and/or visit the WGU Writing Center.

6. Submit for task 1.

## TASK 2: Observing leadership in others

1. Review the email and the video about the two teams in conflict. You will be asked to make observations about the people in the meeting for task 2. The email and video are in the Task 2 details. Scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see the links for both.

2. Using the template (See attached below) answer the questions about the meeting. Be sure to address all that is being asked in the question. Several questions require you to discuss all the team members’ actions.

3. Proofread your task. Inspect your work for articulation errors and proper APA format. Use the APA Reference to assist (see below) . If additional help is needed with either articulation or APA format, use Grammarly, and/or visit the WGU Writing Center.
