# D330 Data Systems Administrations Terms

## Table 8.1: Oracle Database 12c Objects

- **Table**
  - A table is the basic form of data storage. A table has columns and stores rows of data.
- **View**
  - A view is a stored query. No data-storage space is occupied for view data.
- **Index**
  - An index is an optional structure that is useful for fetching data faster.
- **Materialized view**
  - Materialized views are used to summarize and store data. They are similar to views but take up storage space to store data.
- **Index-organized table**
  - An index-organized table stores the table data along with the index, instead of storing table and index separately.
- **Cluster**
  - A cluster is a group of tables sharing a common column. The cluster stores the rows of the tables together with the common columns stored once.
- **Constraint**
  - A constraint is a stored rule to enforce data integrity.
- **Sequence**
  - A sequence provides a mechanism for the continuous generation of numbers.
- **Synonym**
  - A synonym is an alias for a database schema object.
- **Trigger**
  - A trigger is a PL/SQL program unit that is executed when an event occurs.
- **Stored function**
  - Stored functions are PL/SQL programs that can be used to create user-defined functions to return a value.
- **Stored procedure**
  - Stored procedures are PL/SQL programs to define a business process.
- **Package**
  - A package is a collection of procedures, functions, and other program constructs.
- **Java**
  - Stored Java procedures can be created in Oracle to define business processes.
- **Database link**
  - Database links are used to communicate between databases to share data.
- 10 % Which net service naming method requires the client to use a fixed port number? % Local,External,Host,Directory
  - The correct answer is: **Host**
  - Here's why:
    - Local Naming: This method uses a local file (tnsnames.ora) on the client to store connection information, including the port number. The client can potentially specify a different port number if needed.
    - External Naming: Similar to Local Naming, external naming relies on an external directory service to store connection details. This service might include the port number, but the client wouldn't necessarily be restricted to a fixed port.
    - Host Naming: This method uses the hostname of the database server to establish a connection. Traditionally, it relies on a well-known default port number (usually 1521 for Oracle) for the specific service. The client cannot specify a different port in this scenario.
    - Directory Naming: Similar to External Naming, directory naming utilizes a directory service to locate connection details. This service likely includes the port number, but the client might not be limited to a fixed port configuration.
  - Therefore, Host Naming is the only method that enforces a fixed port number on the client side.
- 12 % Which information from a remote database is included in the configuration of a database link? % User name,Data files,Tables,Views
  - The information from a remote database included in the configuration of a database link is **User name**.
  - Database links are configured on the local database and specify how to connect to the remote database. The user name is a crucial piece of information required to establish a secure connection and grant access to the remote database.
  - Here's why the other options are not included:
  - Data files: The location of data files is specific to the remote database and not relevant to how the local database connects to it.
  - Tables & Views: Database links provide a way to access tables and views on the remote database, but their definitions and structures are not stored in the local database link configuration.
- 13 % Which object can be added to an existing bigfile tablespace? % datafiletemp table,table data,tablespacedictionary table,undo data
  - The correct answer is: **table data**
  - Bigfile tablespaces are designed to store large objects (LOBs) efficiently. Here's why the other options are not suitable for bigfile tablespaces:
  - datafiletemp table: Temporary tables are typically used for short-lived data and are not ideal candidates for bigfile tablespaces.
  - tablespacedictionary table: Dictionary-managed tablespaces are a different type of tablespace and not compatible with bigfile tablespaces.
  - undo data: Undo data is used for rollback purposes and has its own dedicated tablespaces, separate from user data.
  - Bigfile tablespaces excel at storing large data objects like:
    - LOBs (Binary Large OBjects) - Can hold multimedia data (images, audio, video) or large text documents.
    - NESTED TABLES - Nested tables allow storing hierarchical data within a single table.
    - VARRAYs - Variable-size arrays can hold collections of elements within a table.
  - By adding table data containing these large objects to a bigfile tablespace, you can leverage its features like:
    - Larger file size limits: Bigfile tablespaces support much larger file sizes compared to traditional tablespaces, accommodating massive data objects.
    - Improved performance: Bigfile tablespaces can optimize storage and retrieval of large objects, enhancing query performance.
- 17 % Which package should an administrator use to configure local extent management for tablespaces? % DBMS_SPACE_ADMIN,DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT,DBMS_TRANSFORM,DBMS_METADATA
  - The correct answer is: **DBMS_SPACE_ADMIN**
  - The DBMS_SPACE_ADMIN package provides procedures for managing locally managed tablespaces in Oracle. This includes configuring local extent management, such as:
  - Creating locally managed tablespaces with the AUTOALLOCATE or UNIFORM extent management clauses.
  - Adding datafiles to a locally managed tablespace.
  - Dropping datafiles from a locally managed tablespace.
  - Migrating a tablespace between local and dictionary extent management.
- The other options listed are not relevant for configuring local extent management:
  - DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT: This package is used for managing auditing settings in the database.
  - DBMS_TRANSFORM: This package is used for data transformation tasks.
  - DBMS_METADATA: This package provides access to metadata information about the database schema, but it's not used for managing tablespace extent allocation.
- 18 % What should an administrator use to identify tables that are fragmented? % Segment Advisor,Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor,DBMS_SPACE,DBMS_REPAIR
  - The most suitable option for identifying fragmented tables in Oracle is: **Segment Advisor**.
  - Here's why:
  - Segment Advisor: This built-in Oracle utility analyzes tables and indexes to identify potential fragmentation issues. It provides recommendations for reorganizing fragmented objects to improve performance.
  - Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM): While ADDM can monitor overall database health and identify performance bottlenecks, it doesn't specifically target table fragmentation.
  - DBMS_SPACE: This package offers functionalities related to managing tablespace storage, but it doesn't directly assess table fragmentation.
  - DBMS_REPAIR: This package focuses on repairing damaged database objects and doesn't provide specific insights into fragmentation.
  - Segment Advisor offers valuable features for analyzing fragmentation:
    - Identifying Fragmentation Types: It can detect different types of fragmentation, including chained and scattered extents, which can hinder query performance.
    - Estimating Reorganization Benefit: The advisor can estimate the potential performance gains achievable by reorganizing fragmented tables.
    - Recommendation Generation: It suggests appropriate reorganization methods, such as rebuild or truncate/reinsert, to optimize table layout.
  - While other tools have their roles in database management, Segment Advisor stands out as the primary choice for pinpointing fragmented tables in Oracle.
- 19 % Which parameter determines how long information should be kept before it is overwritten in an undo tablespace? % UNDO_RETENTION,DBA_FLASHBACK_RETENTION_TARGET,SORT_AREA_RETAINED_SIZE,UNDO_MANAGEMENT
  - The correct answer is: **UNDO_RETENTION**
  - The UNDO_RETENTION parameter in Oracle dictates how long the database attempts to retain undo information for transactions before it gets overwritten in the undo tablespace. It essentially sets a minimum threshold for undo data retention.
  - Here's why the other options are not relevant:
  - DBA_FLASHBACK_RETENTION_TARGET: This is a data dictionary view that shows the current retention target for flashback operations. It reflects the combined effects of various factors, including UNDO_RETENTION and automatic undo management settings.
  - SORT_AREA_RETAINED_SIZE: This parameter manages the memory allocated for sorting operations within the database. It has no bearing on undo data retention.
  - UNDO_MANAGEMENT: This parameter specifies whether undo management is automatic or manual. While it influences undo behavior, it doesn't directly control the retention period.
- 22 % Which condition is automatically resolved by Oracle without human intervention? % Deadlocks,"Snapshot too old" error,Resumable space allocation,Flash recovery area
  - Out of the given options, only **Deadlocks** are automatically resolved by Oracle without human intervention.
  - Here's why the other options are not automatically resolved:
    - "Snapshot too old" error: This error occurs when a flashback operation attempts to access data from a point in time that is beyond the retention period defined by the database. Human intervention is required to address this by potentially adjusting retention settings or using alternative recovery methods.
    - Resumable space allocation: This is a feature that allows Oracle to automatically resume space allocation for objects after encountering certain errors. However, it might not always be successful, and human intervention might be needed to troubleshoot the underlying cause of the allocation failure.
    - Flash recovery area (FRA): The FRA is a designated storage area for backups and archived redo logs. While it plays a crucial role in recovery, it doesn't automatically resolve issues. A human administrator would need to utilize the FRA for recovery purposes.
  - Deadlocks, on the other hand, are a specific scenario where two or more transactions are waiting for resources held by each other, creating a stalemate. Oracle can detect deadlocks and automatically terminate one of the involved transactions to resolve the situation and allow the others to proceed.
- 23 % Which feature allows a failed transaction to be suspended until the problem that caused the failure is resolved? % Resumable space allocation,Segment shrinking,Instance recovery,Oracle managed files
  - Out of the listed options, **Resumable space allocation** is the closest feature that allows a partially failed transaction to be suspended until the issue is resolved.
  - Here's why the other options are not ideal fits:
    - Segment shrinking: This feature deals with reclaiming unused space within a segment after data deletion. It doesn't directly address suspending failed transactions.
    - Instance recovery: This refers to recovering an entire Oracle instance from an outage or failure, not specific transactions.
    - Oracle managed files: This feature automates the management of datafiles, but it doesn't have functionalities to suspend failed transactions.
  - It's important to note that resumable space allocation doesn't guarantee complete suspension of a failed transaction. It might allow resuming the space allocation process if interrupted due to storage-related issues, but it wouldn't necessarily handle other causes of transaction failure.
  - In Oracle, transactions are ACID compliant, meaning they should be Atomic (all or nothing), Consistent, Isolated, and Durable. Once a transaction fails due to any reason, it usually rolls back entirely, and Oracle doesn't have a built-in mechanism to suspend them midway.
- 24 % Which view has space information? % DBA_OBJECTS,V$TABLESPACE,V$SQLTEXT,DBA_DATA_FILES
  - The correct view in Oracle that contains information about database space is: **V$TABLESPACE**
  - Here's why:
    - V$TABLESPACE: This system view provides comprehensive details regarding tablespaces in the database, including:
      - Tablespace name
      - Total space allocated to the tablespace
      - Used space within the tablespace
      - Free space available in the tablespace
      - Whether the tablespace is online or offline
      - The type of tablespace (e.g., permanent, temporary)
    - DBA_OBJECTS: This view contains information about database objects like tables, views, and indexes. While it might show the tablespace an object resides in, it doesn't offer dedicated space usage statistics.
    - V$SQLTEXT: This view stores the parsed SQL text of statements currently executing in the database. It's not related to space information.
    - DBA_DATA_FILES: This view specifically shows details about datafiles associated with the database. While datafiles contribute to the overall space picture, V$TABLESPACE provides a more holistic view of tablespace space usage.
- 25 % An administrator attempts to roll back a transaction from the previous day. The rollback attempt fails. Which action will prevent the failure from recurring? % Enabling the retention guarantee,Setting the session to be resumable,Flushing the log buffer,Restarting the database
  - Answer: **Enabling the retention guarantee**
    - Enabling the retention guarantee ensures that Oracle retains undo information for a minimum specified time period. This guarantee applies to transactions across sessions and would likely cover undo data from the previous day, allowing the rollback to proceed successfully.
  - Here's why the other options are less likely to solve the issue:
    - Setting the session to be resumable: Resumable sessions are useful for suspending long-running transactions that might encounter errors. However, this wouldn't impact the ability to rollback a transaction from a previous day.
    - Flushing the log buffer: Flushing the log buffer primarily ensures that recently committed data is written to disk. It doesn't influence the availability of undo information needed for a rollback from a previous day.
    - Restarting the database: While restarting the database might resolve temporary glitches, it's unlikely to address a scenario where undo information from a previous day is unavailable for rollback.
- 26 % What is the impact of setting the value of the undo retention initialization parameter to 900 in an undo tablespace that uses a fixed size? % Data for committed transactions will be kept for the specified period of time.,Data for committed transactions will be overwritten if an active transaction needs the space.,Up to 900 MB of data will be protected from being overwritten.,Up to 900 transactions will be protected from being overwritten.
  - In an undo tablespace with a fixed size, setting the UNDO_RETENTION parameter to 900 has limited impact. Here's why:
  - Fixed Size Tablespace: When using a fixed-size undo tablespace, Oracle prioritizes utilizing the entire allocated space for undo information.
  - UNDO_RETENTION Suggestion: The UNDO_RETENTION parameter serves as a recommendation in this scenario. Oracle might not strictly adhere to this value and may overwrite undo data even before 900 seconds if space is needed for new transactions.
  - So, the most accurate statement is: **Data for committed transactions will be overwritten if an active transaction needs the space**.
  - In essence, the UNDO_RETENTION parameter has a weaker influence on undo retention in fixed-size tablespaces. Oracle's primary goal is to maximize undo space utilization, and it might overwrite older undo data even before the specified retention period if space demands arise.
  - Here's a breakdown of the other options and why they're not quite correct:
    - Data for committed transactions will be kept for the specified period of time: This might not always be true in a fixed-size undo tablespace due to space constraints.
    - Up to 900 MB of data will be protected from being overwritten: The parameter value (900) doesn't directly translate to a specific amount of data (MB) being protected.
    - Up to 900 transactions will be protected from being overwritten: The parameter doesn't guarantee protection for a specific number of transactions. It relates to the time duration for which undo information should be retained.
- 27 % Which parameter disables conventional path loading when using SQL\*Loader? % PARALLEL,SILENT,DIRECT,RESUMABLE
  - The correct parameter to disable conventional path loading when using SQL\*Loader is: **DIRECT**
  - Here's why:
    - Conventional Path Loading: This is the default method in SQL\*Loader. It uses SQL INSERT statements to load data into the database tables.
    - Direct Path Loading: When the DIRECT parameter is specified, SQL\*Loader bypasses the standard SQL INSERT path. Instead, it formats the data directly into database block structures and writes them efficiently to the datafiles. This method offers significant performance improvements for large data loads.
  - The other options have different purposes:
    - PARALLEL: This parameter enables parallel processing for the load job, potentially speeding it up by utilizing multiple CPU cores. However, it doesn't affect the data loading path (conventional or direct).
    - SILENT: This parameter suppresses informational messages typically displayed during the load process. It doesn't influence the loading method.
    - RESUMABLE: This parameter allows resuming a partially completed load job in case of interruptions. It also doesn't affect the chosen loading path.
- 28 % What allows users to capture data from non-Oracle sources into an Oracle database? % `SQL*Loader`,Recovery Manager,Transportable Tablespaces,Import Transformation
  - The correct answer is **`SQL*Loader`**.
  - `SQL*Loader` is a utility provided by Oracle that allows users to load data from external sources, such as flat files, into Oracle databases. It is designed to efficiently load large volumes of data from various input data sources, including non-Oracle databases, spreadsheets, and other file formats.
  - `SQL*Loader` offers several features and benefits, including:
    1. Data loading from various input sources: `SQL*Loader` can read data from various input sources, such as flat files (delimited or fixed-length), external tables, and even from other databases.
    2. Direct path load: `SQL*Loader` can perform a direct path load, which bypasses the SQL engine and writes data directly to the database files, resulting in faster load times for large data volumes.
    3. Data transformation: `SQL*Loader` allows users to apply data transformations, such as data type conversions, trimming, and data masking, during the load process.
    4. Loading into multiple tables: `SQL*Loader` can load data into multiple tables in a single operation, supporting complex data relationships.
    5. Parallel loading: For large data volumes, `SQL*Loader` can take advantage of parallel processing to improve load performance.
  - The other options you provided are not directly related to loading data from non-Oracle sources into an Oracle database:
    - Recovery Manager: This utility is used for backup and recovery operations in Oracle databases.
    - Transportable Tablespaces: This feature allows moving tablespaces between Oracle databases, but it does not load data from non-Oracle sources.
    - Import Transformation: There is no such utility in Oracle. The closest option would be `SQL*Loader`, which can perform data transformations during the load process.
- 29 % Which SQL statement is allowed with external tables? % UPDATE,DELETE,SELECT,INSERT
  - Out of the listed SQL statements, the only one allowed with external tables is: **SELECT**
  - Here's the reasoning:
    - External Tables: These tables represent data residing in external files or locations outside the Oracle database. They are read-only and cannot be directly modified.
    - Supported statement: The SELECT statement allows you to retrieve data from the external table as if it were a regular table within the database.
  - The other statements are not applicable to external tables:
    - UPDATE: This statement is used for modifying existing data in a table. Since external tables are read-only, updates cannot be performed on them.
    - DELETE: This statement is used for removing data from a table. Similar to updates, deletes are not allowed on external tables due to their read-only nature.
    - INSERT: This statement is used for inserting new data into a table. External tables cannot be directly written to using INSERT as they are pre-populated with data from external sources.
  - Working with External Tables:
    - While you cannot modify data within an external table itself, you can achieve data manipulation indirectly through techniques like:
      - Importing data from the external table into a regular Oracle table: Use INSERT INTO ... SELECT `*` FROM external_table to create a copy of the data in a modifiable table. You can then update or delete records in this table.
      - Using external tables as sources for views: Create views referencing the external table and incorporating any necessary transformations or filtering logic. This allows you to present a customized view of the external data.
- 30 % An administrator plans to use `SQL*Loader` to import a data file using a fixed-width format. Which file must be configured before importing the file? % Control,Data,Bad,Discard
  - In the scenario of using `SQL*Loader` to import a fixed-width data file, the essential file to configure beforehand is the: **Control File**.
  - Here's why:
    - Control File: This file acts as the blueprint for `SQL*Loader`, instructing it on how to interpret the data in the external file (usually the data file). It specifies details like:
      - File location: Path to the data file containing the actual data to be loaded.
      - Table definition: Describes the target table structure in the Oracle database, including column names, data types, and any constraints.
      - Data format: Defines how data is organized within the fixed-width format, specifying column positions, lengths, and delimiters (if used).
      - Loading options: Specifies how the data should be loaded (e.g., replace existing data, append new data).
    - The control file is crucial for guiding `SQL*Loader` through the import process, ensuring it accurately maps data from the fixed-width file to the corresponding columns in the target Oracle table.
  - Other Files:
    - Data File: This is the actual file containing the data to be imported, formatted according to the specifications outlined in the control file.
    - Bad File (Optional): This file can be optionally used to capture rows that encounter errors during the import process. `SQL*Loader` can write these problematic rows to the bad file for further investigation.
    - Discard File (Optional): This file can be used to discard specific rows based on conditions defined within the control file. Discarded rows are not loaded into the target table.
- 31 % Which tool identifies potential performance bottlenecks? % Cluster Verification Utility,Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor,Oracle Data Guard Broker,Privilege Analysis
  - Out of the listed options, the tool that identifies potential performance bottlenecks in an Oracle database is: **Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)**
  - ADDM is a built-in Oracle utility that continuously monitors various aspects of database activity, including:
    - SQL statement execution times
    - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
    - Wait events and their impact on performance
  - Based on its monitoring data, ADDM can identify potential performance bottlenecks within the database. It provides valuable recommendations, such as:
    - Identifying frequently executed slow queries
    - Highlighting inefficient execution plans
    - Suggesting indexes for tables with frequent full table scans
  - By leveraging ADDM's insights, database administrators can proactively address performance issues and optimize database performance.
  - Here's why the other options are not meant for performance bottleneck identification:
    - Cluster Verification Utility: This tool focuses on verifying the health and consistency of an Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) environment. While it might indirectly uncover performance issues related to cluster configuration, it's not its primary function.
    - Oracle Data Guard Broker: This component manages communication and synchronization between primary and standby databases in an Oracle Data Guard configuration. It's not directly involved in performance bottleneck analysis.
    - Privilege Analysis: This functionality helps review and audit user privileges within the database. While excessive privileges can sometimes impact performance, privilege analysis is not a core tool for identifying performance bottlenecks.
