## Table 8.1: Oracle Database 12c Objects

- **Table**
  - A table is the basic form of data storage. A table has columns and stores rows of data.

- **Index**
  - An index is an optional structure that is useful for fetching data faster.
- **Materialized view**
  - Materialized views are used to summarize and store data. They are similar to views but take up storage space to store data.
- **Index-organized table**
  - An index-organized table stores the table data along with the index, instead of storing table and index separately.
- **Cluster**
  - A cluster is a group of tables sharing a common column. The cluster stores the rows of the tables together with the common columns stored once.
- **Constraint**
  - A constraint is a stored rule to enforce data integrity.
