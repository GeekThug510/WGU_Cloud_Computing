- **WGU Chatter**
  - **Spencer G**: heavy focus on security so know your encryption types (at Rest, In Transit, Client\Server.) Know KMS and CloudHSM. Know your IAM policies and review policies in general. Also understand your Databases - Aurora, DynamoDB, RDBMS. Know your EFS, FSx, EBS, S3 + lifecycles. Try to look for keywords like "Serverless". Exam Dojo and Udemy can be used but I feel like they're harder than the OA since they involve connecting 2-3 services together while the OA is mainly just 1 service at a time but with more depth on that specific service. I used the Course Material Section review questions and Percipio Testprep as the bulk of study for my practice questions.
  - **JW M**: knowing S3 and its Lifecycle policies, what CloudHSM is, The different VPC Endpoints and what each one does, CloudFront, and how Aurora and NoSQL are DIFFERENT from other databases.
  - **Denise W**: heavy on encryption and the differences between Relational vs Non-relational databases.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework (Six Pillars)

- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html>
- **Operational excellence**
  - run and monitor(logging) systems. fix quickly and safely.
  - IaC reduces mistakes and increases reliability.
- **Security**
  - protect at all layers(data, systems, assets).
  - enable traceability(log of all changes and access).
  - risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
- **Reliability**
  - recover from infrastructure or service disruption.
  - dynamic recovery, scale, mitigation.
- **Performance efficiency**
  - most efficient resource selection as demand changes.
  - democratize: use ready made solutions for advanced problems.
  - mechanical sympathy: understand best way to take advantage of services, resources.
- **Cost optimization**
  - measure efficiency. eliminate unneeded expense. reduce employee overhead with managed services.
  -
- **Sustainability**

## Best Practices

- **Enable Scalability**
  - dynamic scale based on load. increase availability.
- **Automate your environment**
  - dynamic increase/decrease infrastructure.
  - automate monitoring/notifying when resources change.
- **Treat resources as disposable**
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC). declarative control infrastructure.
  - terminate resources not in use.
- **Use loosely-coupled components**
  - avoid tightly-coupled resources.
  - ![loosely-coupled components](img/loosely-coupled.PNG)
- **Design services, not servers**
  - use AWS services to connect your infrastructure.
  - containers(docker), ephemeral(IaC), Queues handle communication between applications.
  - static assets stored in S3.
- **Choose the right database solutions**
  - acceptable latency, max concurrent users, data integrity.
- **Avoid single points of failure**
  - create secondary systems to avoid single point failure.
  - ![single point failure](img/single-point-failure.PNG)
- **Optimize for cost**
  - CapEx: capital expense. One-time investments in long-term assets. (e.g. hardware servers)
  - OpEx: operational expense. Ongoing costs associated with running the project. (e.g. software license, pay-as-you-go).
- **Use Caching**
  - request are faster, increase data throughput.
  - ![caching](img/caching.PNG)
- **Secure your entire infrastructure**
  - encrypt data transit and rest.
  - network isolation.
  - least privilege access. MFA.
  - traceability(log every change, access).
  - IaC. automation ensures consistent security.

## Definitions

- **Availability Zone (AZ)**
  - **one or more data centers** geographically separated from each other with redundant power, and networking.
  - networked together through the **AWS backbone network**.
  - ![availability zone](img/availability_zone.PNG)
- **AWS Local Zone**
  - extension of Region that is closer to end user(edge).
  - compute, storage, database **closer to large populations** where **no Region exist**. (e.g. Los Angeles Local Zone).
- **Cloud Front**
  - over 200 points-of-presence (PoP), edge locations and edge caches.
  - ![cloud front](img/cloud_front.PNG)
- **Data Centers**
  - location of physical servers. redundant hardware, power, cooling, and networking.
  - networked to other data centers through the **AWS backbone network**.
- **Region**
  - Geographical location with **two or more availability zones**. (e.g us-east-1, eu-west-1).
  - Most services provided by AWS are **region scoped**. (e.g. data for a service used in one region is not replicated in another region).
  - China and GovCloud regions have restricted access.
