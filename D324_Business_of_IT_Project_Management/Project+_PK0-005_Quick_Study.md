  - The **process of how change is brought up and put into play**. Know every. single. step. front and back, had a lot of questions regarding what to be done after a certain step
  - Know what happens during all the **steps of a project beginning with Initiation all the way to Closing**.
  - Know differences and **characteristic between functional, projectized, matrix structures**. Given a scenario, be able to say "this is a functional structure" or "this is projectized", etc.
  - Really know the different **roles**, what they can and cant do.
  - What encompasses the charter, scope, WBS.
  - Know the different **risk strategies** and be able to assign them to an example (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid, exploit).
  - Know the different **communication methods**, I had a ton of these which kind of surprised me. Know which one is appropriate for certain scenarios (this was a very annoying part of the test because the questions didn't have much context at all so I really had to guess at times)
  - I memorized the formulas for **CV, SV, CPI, SPI and literally had 0 questions** on them which was unfortunate, I know some people get questions on them so may be valuable for you. Wasn't for me

## Project Phases

1. Initiating Phase

   1. Identifying project needs
   2. defining project objectives
   3. conducting feasibility studies
   4. creating a project charter
   5. securing stakeholder buy-in
   6. identifying risks and assumptions.

2. Planning Phase:

   - documents that describes what the team will deliver and how they will deliver them.
     - Scope Statement
     - WBS or Backlog
     - Resource Plan
     - Project Schedule (Gantt chart, PERT chart)
     - Quality Management Plan
     - Risk Management Plan
     - Communication Plan
     - Stakeholder Management Plan
     - Project Baseline
     - Project Budget
     - Project Plan Approval.

3. Executing Phase:

   - where work is performed, monitored, and tracked. If product does not conform, change request are created.
     - Producing and verifying deliverables
     - Implementing change management
     - Managing vendors
     - Tracking and reporting project results
     - Updating project elements such as budget, risk, and timelines
     - Managing conflict
     - Monitoring the risks and issues log
     - Performing quality assurance/governance activities such as coordinating phase gate reviews
     - Monitoring the budget
     - Conducting project meetings and updates

4. Closing Phase:

   - project closeout. contracts closed, team members released.
   - Project teams can use **organizational change management (OCM)** to reduce the strain caused by change.
   - validate deliverables, document acceptance of project work.
     - Validating deliverables
     - Closing contracts
     - Removing access
     - Releasing resources
     - Holding the project closure meeting
     - Writing the project closeout report
     - Obtaining feedback and lesson learned
     - Project sign-off
     - Handing off the product to the organization
     - Evaluating the project
     - Archiving project documents
     - Rewards and celebration

## Frameworks

- **Agile**
  - Agile: iterative, incremental. delivers value early and often. Teams small (3-10 members).
    - Iterative: make improvements, get feedback.
    - Incremental: small improvements at a time.
  - cross-functional group that stays with project entire lifecycle.
  - members fill multiple roles and have broad experience.
  - Backlog breaks work into smaller units.
- **DevOps**
  - automating checks and tests along with development and operations.
  - Problem: Siloed development and operations teams create communication barriers, inefficiencies, and slow code delivery.
  - Solution: DevOps integrates these teams, practices, and tools to optimize the entire software delivery process.
  - Automation: CI/CD automates builds, tests, and deployments for faster releases.
  - Continuous feedback: Early detection and fix of bugs through frequent integration and monitoring.
- **Extreme Programming**
  - agile framework. software development. pair programming, emphasis on simplicity.
  - XP: close collaboration, iterative development, and continuous testing.
  - **Extreme Programming Pair programming**
    - Two developers work together on code, promoting continuous review and knowledge sharing.
- **Kanban**
  - agile framework.
  - Kanban board: Visualizes work, WIP(work in progress) limits, and workflow policies.
  - track task flow and optimize workflow.
  - Simplest agile framework to learn and can be applied to any industry.
  - ![kanban board](img/kanban.webp)
  - **Kanban 3 basic phases**
    - To Do, In Progress, Done (can be customized).
  - **Kanban 6 Core Practices**
    1. Visualize work: show phase work is in.
    2. Limit WIP: prevent overwhelm, increase product quality by restricting active tasks.
    3. Make policies explicit: clearly define how work moves through phases.
    4. Manage flow: Identify and eliminate workflow bottlenecks for efficiency.
    5. Implement feedback loops: Measure workflow performance and use data for improvement.
    6. Improve collaboratively: Experiment and continuously evolve the workflow.
- **PRINCE2**
  - process-based methodology. Common in UK, EU, Canada, Australia.
  - focus on clear project phases, roles, and responsibilities.
  - originally waterfall methodology, but has embraced the agile model.
  - has 7 principles, 7 themes, 7 processes.
- **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**
  - expand agile practices across multiple teams to work together.
  - Agile Release Team (ART): related groups of agile teams to simplify communication, planning, schedules.
  - Iteration: short term planning cycle.
  - Program Increment: longer-term planning cycle.
- **Scrum**
  - iterative and incremental agile framework doing short sprints and team collaboration with daily stand-ups.
  - emphasizes empiricism(**learn from doing not just guessing**) and lean thinking(**focus on value**), promoting continual improvement.
  - Scrum is an **all-or-nothing framework**, requiring the use of all its parts for optimal results.
  - It introduces roles like the Scrum team(3-9 peeps), product owner(backlog owner), Scrum master(implement scrum principles), and developers(remaining team).
  - **Scrum 5 Values**
    - Commitment, focus, openness, respect, courage.
  - **Scrum 3 Pillars**
    - Transparency(clear goals), inspection(asses work), adaptation(make adjustments from feedback).
- **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**
  - produce high-quality, low-cost, thoroughly tested software.
  - **SDLC 7 phases**
    1. Planning: outline project scope and purpose.
    2. Requirements: define resources needed and software purpose.
    3. Design & Prototyping: specifications of software: language, security, interface.
    4. Development: write code.
    5. Testing: software compatibility and performs as expected.
    6. Deployment: deploy to production environment.
    7. Operations and Maintenance: support software.
- **Waterfall**
  - follows linear sequence. Work only flows one way. Teams any size.
  - documentation heavy.
  - Regular on/off boarding(highly specialized members flow in and out of project as needed).
  - Resources are typically fixed(backend, get python developer).
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks work into smaller units.
- **Waterfall 6 phases**
  1. requirements: project requirements.
  2. design: actionable specifications.
  3. implementation: do work.
  4. testing: verify.
  5. delivery: deploy to customer.
  6. maintenance: customer support.
