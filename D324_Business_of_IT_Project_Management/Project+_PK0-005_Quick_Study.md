## Scaled Agile Framework

- **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**
  - expand agile practices across multiple teams to work together.
  - Agile Release Team (ART): related groups of agile teams to simplify communication, planning, schedules.
  - Iteration: short term planning cycle.
  - Program Increment: longer-term planning cycle.
- **SAFe Strengths**
  - allows scaling and project organization in bigger organizations with multiple agile teams.
- **SAFe Weakness**
  - adds layers of overhead to organization.
- **SAFe Use**
  - multiple agile teams that need to collaborate more effectively.

## Scrum

- **Scrum**
  - iterative and incremental agile framework doing short sprints and team collaboration with daily stand-ups.
  - emphasizes empiricism(**learn from doing not just guessing**) and lean thinking(**focus on value**), promoting continual improvement.
  - Scrum is an **all-or-nothing framework**, requiring the use of all its parts for optimal results.
  - It introduces roles like the Scrum team(3-9 peeps), product owner(backlog owner), Scrum master(implement scrum principles), and developers(remaining team).
- **Scrum 5 Values**
  - Commitment, focus, openness, respect, courage.
- **Scrum 3 Pillars**
  - Transparency(clear goals), inspection(asses work), adaptation(make adjustments from feedback).
- **Scrum Events**
  - Sprint: iteration and all scrum events.
  - Sprint planning: backlog created.
  - Daily Scrum: review progress, plan next 24 hours(daily stand-up).
  - Sprint review: uncover issues early, confirm on track.
  - Sprint retrospective: find improvement opportunities(improve scrum flow) from previous sprint.
- **Scrum Key Artifacts**
  - Product Backlog: list of changes.
  - Product Goal: long term target.
  - Sprint Backlog: plan for upcoming sprint.
  - Sprint Goal: summarize value of sprint.
  - Increment: meets the 'done' definition and move to next product goal.
- **Scrum Strengths**
  - short cycles allow responsive learning, complex problem solving fro unpredictable work.
- **Scrum Weakness**
  - teams must be highly cohesive, cross-functional. No large groups.

## Software Development Lifecycle SDLC

- **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**
  - produce high-quality, low-cost, thoroughly tested software.
- **SDLC 7 phases**
  1. Planning: outline project scope and purpose.
  2. Requirements: define resources needed and software purpose.
  3. Design & Prototyping: specifications of software: language, security, interface.
  4. Development: write code.
  5. Testing: software compatibility and performs as expected.
  6. Deployment: deploy to production environment.
  7. Operations and Maintenance: support software.
- **SDLC Waterfall Model**
  - sequential model, good for short task or well defined, no change projects.
- **SDLC Iterative Model**
  - hybrid. combines iterative with sequential models.
- **SDLC Spiral Model**
  - risk-centric iterative model.
  - most complex and resource-intensive model. Projects can 'spiral' out of control with cost and scope.
- **SDLC Agile Model**
  - similar to iterative model, but with more customer feedback.
  - helps with fast time-to-market projects.
- **SDLC Strengths**
  - comprehensive framework.
- **SDLC Weaknesses**
  - project success depends on time spent on advanced planning.

## Waterfall

- **Waterfall**
  - follows linear sequence. Work only flows one way. Teams any size.
  - documentation heavy.
  - Regular on/off boarding(highly specialized members flow in and out of project as needed).
  - Resources are typically fixed(backend, get python developer).
- **Waterfall 6 phases**
  1. requirements: project requirements.
  2. design: actionable specifications.
  3. implementation: do work.
  4. testing: verify.
  5. delivery: deploy to customer.
  6. maintenance: customer support.
- **Waterfall Communication: Stakeholder, Customer, Changes**
  - Stakeholder: provides comprehensive requirements at start, then review finished product.
  - Customer: customer does not communicate with developer.
  - Communication Changes: very few changes.
- **Waterfall Requirements**
  - requirements dictate how the project looks and behaves.
  - requirements must all be stated at start of project.
  - Collection of Requirements -> Product Creation -> Customer Review -> Maintenance Phase(fix after customer review).
- **Waterfall Budget and Schedule**
  - Budget: fixed, strict, predictable. Good for 'limited' budget.
  - Schedule: predictable. Entire project is planned in advance.
- **Waterfall Environmental Factors: Culture, Development Processes, Industry Standards**
  - Culture: favors vast knowledge and role specialization.
  - Development Processes: customer receives finished product.
  - Industry Standards: linear and sequential. Heavy documentation.
- **Waterfall Use**
  - when you have clear objectives, heavy documentation, and high change cost.
