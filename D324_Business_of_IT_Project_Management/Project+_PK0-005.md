## Project Lifecycle Phase 2 Planning: Scheduling, Dependencies, Estimation, Baselines, Testing

- **Scheduling**
  - defining units of work, cost, resources for a project.
- **Scheduling: Define and Create WBS**
  - Work Breakdown Structure: deliverable-oriented hierarchy that describes required work.
    - waterfall.
  - major deliverables are broken down into smaller components, for time and cost estimation.
  - ![work breakdown structure chart](img/WBS.jpg)
- **Scheduling: WBS levels**
  - highest level: project name.
  - second level: major deliverables.
  - sub levels: subprojects.
  - lowest level: work package.
  - ![work breakdown structure chart](img/WBS.jpg)
- **Scheduling: WBS Dictionary**
  - describes each deliverable, resources, tracking code(for accounting), criteria for success.
  - similar to 'scope'.
- **Scheduling: Analogous Estimating vs Bottom-Up Estimating**
  - Analogous: estimating top-Down. Expert judgement, historical information.
  - Bottom-Up: estimates for each work item, rolls them into a total.
- **Scheduling: Task Sequencing**
  - identify proper scheduling order of project activities.
- **Scheduling: Two Major Relationships between Dependent Task**
  - predecessor: project that must be completed before task.
  - successor: project that must be completed after task.
- **Scheduling: Three Most Common Activity Estimators**
  - Expert Judgement: someone experienced.
  - Analogous or Top-Down: artifact(similar activities) from previous project.
  - Parametric: quantitatively-based estimates (rate x quantity).
- **Scheduling: CPM**
  - Critical Path Method: finding the longest stretch to dependencies(sequential activities).
  - exposes task that risk missing the finish date.
  - Three things needed:
    - list of all project task.
    - project dependencies.
    - time each task will take.
- **Scheduling: Calculate Critical Path**
  - which path adds up to the longest. Any delay will result in missing the finish date.
  - ![critical path](img/critical-path.png)
- **Scheduling: Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)**
  - created in the initiation phase. Activities are added in the planning phase.
  - clarifies team member assignment(ownership roles) and who to work with.
  - every activity must have one and only one accountable person.
  - **RACI**: (what role does team member fall into?)
    - responsible: do the work.
    - accountable: manager.
    - consulted: Subject Matter Experts.
    - informed: receive updates only(stakeholder, senior manager...).
    - ![ram chart](img/ram_chart.PNG)
- **Define Critical Path Task**
  - critical path task activity with zero or negative float.
- **Dependencies and Sequencing. Predecessor and Successor. Four Types of Logical Relationships: FS, SS, SF, FF**

  - Sequencing: order the work must be completed in.
  - predecessor: before task.
  - successor: after task.
  - finish-to-start (FS): predecessor must finish before successor can start.
  - start-to-start (SS): predecessor must start before successor can start.
  - start-to-finish (SF): predecessor must start before successor can finish.
  - finish-to-finish (FF): predecessor must finish before successor finishes.
- **Dependency: Mandatory, Discretionary, External, Internal**

  - Discretionary Dependency: Soft logic. preference only.
  - External Dependency: outside organization control.
  - Internal Dependency: inside organization.
- **Estimation: Top-Down, Bottom-Up, Three Point**
  - Top-Down: estimate entire project.
  - Bottom-Up: estimate smallest task first, then add up.
  - Three Point: `optimistic time + pessimistic time + (4 * average time) / 6 = estimated time.`.
- **Estimation: Story Points, Task**
  - Story Points: use size to visualize cost relative to other User Stories. That is translated into numbers.
  - ![story points](img/story_points.PNG)
  - Task: break down into user stories or work packages.
- **Estimation: Indirect Cost, Resource Cost, Contingency Reserve**
  - Indirect Cost: not related to specific activity. Overhead cost(building and supplies expense, insurance).
  - Resource Cost: tangible items or activities.
  - Contingency Reserve: financial reserve when things go wrong. Buffer of time, money, and resources.
- **Estimation: Reserve Analysis**

  - Resources are typically fixed(backend, get python developer).
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks work into smaller units.
- **Waterfall 6 phases**
  1. requirements: project requirements.
  2. design: actionable specifications.
  3. implementation: do work.
  4. testing: verify.
  5. delivery: deploy to customer.
  6. maintenance: customer support.
- **Waterfall Communication: Stakeholder, Customer, Changes**
  - Stakeholder: provides comprehensive requirements at start, then review finished product.
  - Customer: customer does not communicate with developer.
  - Communication Changes: very few changes.
- **Waterfall Requirements**
  - requirements dictate how the project looks and behaves.
  - requirements must all be stated at start of project.
  - Collection of Requirements -> Product Creation -> Customer Review -> Maintenance Phase(fix after customer review).
- **Waterfall Budget and Schedule**
  - Budget: fixed, strict, predictable. Good for 'limited' budget.
  - Schedule: predictable. Entire project is planned in advance.
- **Waterfall Environmental Factors: Culture, Development Processes, Industry Standards**
  - Culture: favors vast knowledge and role specialization.

    - Roles and Responsibilities: identify the people responsible for managing the program, adhering to standards, and evaluating products against the standards.
    - Deliverables and Approach: identify all deliverables and processes subject to QA activities. Then, list the necessary QC activities, standards, and when they will occur for each deliverable or process.
  - **QA Plan Questions**:
    - how to prevent risk from escaping?
    - how verify meet expectations?
    - how prevent defects?
    - how to recognize and improve process?
    - how to handle defects from customer?

## Work Breakdown Structure

- **WBS**
  - waterfall way of breaking down large projects into deliverables.
  - Each level of the WBS clarifies the work required at that level.
  - Lower levels provide more detail and granularity on how the higher-level work will be accomplished.
  - The structure helps identify all necessary tasks and ensures no crucial work is missed.
  - It facilitates work estimation and resource allocation based on the size and complexity of each unit.
  - Creation Process:
    - Determine Scope: review Statement of Work (SOW). Expectations of project.
      - Level 1: Project (totality of entire project)
    - Identify deliverables, team members, resources.
      - Level 2: Main catagories. Breaks down the project into major deliverables or phases.
      - Level 3: Further breaks down each deliverable/phase into smaller sub-deliverables/sub-phases.
      - Level 4 on onward: breaking down units of work until you reach the level of individual tasks.
  - ![wbs](img/wbs.webp)
  - ![wbs2](img/WBS.jpg)
- **WBS vs Backlog**
  - WBS assumes that scope, time, and cost are fixed and works to control them.
  - WBS has more structure than a backlog in its design. The WBS has specific numbering conventions and design rules, including MECE and the 100% rule.
