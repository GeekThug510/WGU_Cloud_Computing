## 1.2 Compare and contrast AGILE vs. WATERFALL concepts

- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Tolerance for change/flexibility::Requirements
  - Requirements: Highly changeable requirements favor agile methods like Scrum or Kanban, where adaptations happen easily. Waterfall methodology may struggle with frequent changes.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Tolerance for change/flexibility::Budget
  - Budget: Agile methods typically work within flexible budgets, adapting features based on available resources. Waterfall requires a fixed budget with clear scope.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Tolerance for change/flexibility::Schedule
  - Schedule: Agile methods embrace iterative development, potentially adapting deadlines with each iteration. Waterfall follows a predefined schedule with less room for adjustment.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Environmental factors::Cultural
  - Cultural: Collaborative cultures thrive in agile settings, while top-down structures work better with Waterfall.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Environmental factors::Developmental
  - Developmental: Complex projects or unfamiliar technology might benefit from Waterfall's structured approach. Agile methods excel in iterative development for evolving technologies.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Criteria for selecting a method::Environmental factors::Industry standards
  - Industry Standards: Some industries (e.g., government) may have regulations impacting methodology choice.
- AGILE vs. WATERFALL::Team composition::Product ownership::Roles and responsibilities
