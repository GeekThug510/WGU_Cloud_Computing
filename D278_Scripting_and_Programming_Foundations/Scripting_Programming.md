How to use this document

This document is a great final review tool after you have completed all of the course material. It does not replace the exercises and activities in Zybooks. You will need to be familiar looking at and interpreting pseudocode. It can help you determine if you have a good understanding of the concepts from each lesson.

After completing the preassessment, target the areas below competency and use these questions to help identify what is clear and where there may be missing details in your understanding.

Use the zyBooks material to look up any questions you are unable to answer and if you cannot find the answer in the lesson email us at cmcomputerscience@wgu.edu.
