  - Something around 80% of the PA/OA are syntax-based questions like the Section 7 & 8 labs, so you don't need to go super hard into nitty-gritty details about database design or models. I just recommend you have a general understanding of:
  - Database Model Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-one)
  - Definitely make sure you know the following info (This is from Zybooks from chapter 1 that I looked at briefly following a question I had on my PA):
    - Data Definition Language (DDL) defines the structure of the database. CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
    - Data Query Language (DQL) retrieves data from the database. SELECT
    - Data Manipulation Language (DML) Manipulates data stored in a database. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
    - Data Control Language (DCL) controls database user access.
    - Data Transaction Language (DTL) manages database transactions.
