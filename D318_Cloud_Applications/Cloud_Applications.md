## 1.1 Compare and contrast the different types of CLOUD MODELS

- Public Cloud
  - A public cloud is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure and services are **owned and operated by a third-party provider**, such as **Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. Users can access these resources over the internet and pay for them on a pay-as-you-go basis.
  - Same as multitenancy
- Private Cloud
  - A private cloud is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure and services are **dedicated to a single organization**. (GovCloud).
  - Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or in a colocation facility.
  - private clouds offer **exclusive access and control over all hardware, software, and data**. This allows organizations to benefit from the flexibility and scalability of cloud computing while maintaining a high level of security and privacy.
- Hybrid Cloud
  - A hybrid cloud is a combination of **public and private clouds**. This allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both models, such as the **scalability and elasticity of public clouds** and the **security and control of private clouds**.
- Community Cloud
  - A community cloud is a cloud computing model where the **infrastructure and services are shared by a group** of organizations with common interests or needs.
  - Community cloud is shared by just the organizations and not open to the public.
- Cloud within a Cloud or Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  - A cloud within a cloud is a cloud computing model where resources are provisioned from a **public cloud provider but are then isolated and managed as a private cloud**.
  - Unshared by default and not accessible to other customers.
  - Enables customers to have **single tenancy within a multi-tenant infrastructure**.
- Multicloud
  - Multicloud is the practice of **using multiple cloud computing services from different providers**. This can help organizations **avoid vendor lock-in** and take advantage of the best features and services from each provider.
  - Multi-cloud deployments **reduce reliance on a single vendor**, provide greater service flexibility and choice, **permit improved geographic control of data**, and help manage disaster mitigation.
- Multitenancy
  - Same as public cloud.
  - Multi-tenant architecture: multiple instances of an application operate in a shared environment.
  - Multitenancy is a cloud computing model where the **infrastructure and services are shared by multiple organizations**. This allows the provider to provide economies of scale and reduce the cost for users.
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

  - IaaS provides users with on-demand access to virtualized **computing resources**, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users have **full control over the operating system**, applications, and data that run on these resources.
  - The CSP manages hardware failures, firmware updates, device drivers, and hardware compatibility.

- Internet of Things (IoT)
  - IoT is the network of physical devices that are embedded with sensors, software, and **network connectivity**, which allows them to collect and exchange data.
- Serverless
  - Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the **provider manages the servers and infrastructure that run applications**. Users simply write the code and the provider takes care of the rest.
- Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  - Machine learning and artificial intelligence are technologies that allow **computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed**.
  - **AI simulates human intelligence** by providing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and **solving complex problems**. AI accomplishes this by using a set of rules to manage its analysis.
  - Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. The **goal of ML** is to **make accurate predictions** by extracting data based on learned information and experience. ML systems are not explicitly programmed to find a particular outcome. Instead, they are programmed to learn from provided data and then make accurate decisions based on what they’ve learned.
- Shared Responsibility Model
  - The shared responsibility model is a cloud computing model where the **provider and the user share responsibility for security and compliance**.
  - The **CSP is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure**. CSPs will typically provide **physical security** for the datacenter as well as **isolate data** between customers.
  - The **Cloud consumers are responsible for the direct user access security for their own data**.

## 1.3 Explain the importance of HIGH AVAILABILITY and SCALING in cloud environments

- Explain the importance of high availability and scaling in cloud environments?
  - High availability ensures that cloud (and on-premises) resources are **available** to consumers.
  - The primary ways to provide availability are **redundancy**, monitoring, and failover capabilities.
  - High availability and scaling are two fundamental pillars of a robust and efficient cloud environment. They are critical for ensuring **continuous operation**, meeting fluctuating demands, and delivering a seamless **user experience**.
  - High Availability: Minimizing downtime and service disruptions.
  - Scalability: Adding or removing VMs to adapt to growing demands efficiently.
    - elasticity: dynamically adjusting resources based on real-time demand.
  - Cost optimization: Utilizing resources effectively and avoiding unnecessary costs.
  - Enhanced user experience: Delivering consistent and reliable performance.
- High Availability and Scaling Hypervisors: _Affinity_
  - Deliberate **grouping** of VM instances on a **single host** for centralized management.
  - increases performance.
  - **Pros**
    - Ensures that VMs with specific dependencies are placed on the same physical server. This improves performance and reduces latency.
  - **Cons**
    - Creates single point of failure.
    - Hard to scale.
  - Hypervisors are **software** programs that create and **manage virtual machines (VMs)** on a single physical server. They play a crucial role in achieving high availability and scalability.
- High Availability and Scaling in Hypervisors: _Anti-affinity_
  - deliberately **distributes** VM instances across **multiple hosts** to avoid **single points of failure**.
  - increases failover.
  - **Pros**
    - Scaling, redundancy, failover.
  - **Cons**
    - can be more difficult to monitor.
    - slower performance.
- High Availability and Scaling in Oversubscription: _Compute_
  - Oversubscription **allocates more resources** (CPU, RAM, storage) **than** the physical server has **available**.
  - Compute: CPU power and memory space.
  - Monitoring is important to ensure that all available compute resources are not actually consumed and that scaling is configured.
- High Availability and Scaling in Oversubscription: _Network_
  - Network over-allocation offers **more network bandwidth** for use **than** is actually **available**.
  - Can be avoided with Virtual Private Networks(VPN).
- High Availability and Scaling in Oversubscription: _Storage_
  - Storage capacity may be oversold to consumers by CSPs.
  - Storage capacity is usually easy to add, however, so the larger concern is **IOPS and overall read/write speed** for storage resources.
- High Availability and Scaling: _Regions and Zones_
  - Cloud providers offer services across multiple geographically **distributed** regions and zones. This provides **redundancy** and ensures that applications are **available** even if there is an outage in one region.
  - Each Region are geographically distinct areas with two or more zones(data centers).
  - Each region supports a number of availability zones.
  - Availability zones are datacenters with dedicated and redundant power and network connectivity.
  - Fulfill legal requirements if you must be in some region.
- High Availability and Scaling: _Applications_
  - High availability for applications requires **replicating** them **across multiple servers and regions**. This ensures that if one instance fails, another can seamlessly take over.
  - Scalability: Auto-scaling.
  - High Availability: Availability zones.
- High Availability and Scaling: _Containers_
  - Containerization is a form of virtualization, but it is significantly different than VMs. **Containers virtualize at the OS layer**, rather than the hardware layer.
  - A container holds a **single application and everything it needs to run**.
  - Containers are lightweight and portable units of software that share an operating system kernel. They are becoming increasingly popular in cloud environments due to their fast startup times and resource efficiency.
  - Containerization: Packaging applications and their dependencies into containers.
  - Container orchestration: Managing the deployment, scaling, and networking of containers.
  - Highly available containers:
    - Scalability: Auto-scaling
    - High Availability: Docker Swarm or Kubernetes
      - Scale horizontally with VM cluster of redundant nodes.
  - AWS: Elastic Container Service and Elastic Container Registry.
  - ![containerization](img/containerization.PNG)
  - ![kubernetes](img/kubernetes_cluster.jpg)
- High Availability and Scaling: _Clusters_
  - Server failover clusters are a group of two or more integrated servers and often use the same data storage source.
  - Each cluster member is referred to as a node, and all of the nodes are all configured the same way.
  - Each node does the same tasks as the other nodes.
  - Each server is an independent device within the cluster.
  - A cluster of servers is treated as a single entity by clients, and their network identity is a single IP address.
  - They are fundamental for **scaling** applications and workloads **horizontally**.
  - The **purpose** behind server clusters is to provide **high availability** of services and data, **scalability**, **redundancy**, and **load balancing**.
  - Scalability: Auto-scaling
  - High Availability: Clusters
  - ![Cluster](img/cluster.PNG)
- High Availability and Scaling of Network Functions: _Avoid Single Point Failures: Switches, Routers, Load Balancers, Firewalls_
  - Physical infrastructure needs to be turned off, components upgraded, then brought back online. To slow.
  - High Availability is instantly spinning up more infrastructure as needed.
  - Virtual instances can be spread across multiple availability zones.
  - Avoiding Single Point Failures:
    - NIC teaming: Aggregates network connectivity for servers by using two or more NICs
    - Switch: Provides connectivity within network segments
    - Router: Provides connectivity between network segments and filters some traffic
    - Load balancer: Distributes workload requests among servers
    - Firewall: Filters traffic between networks or network segments
    - Proxy: Provides indirect connectivity to network services such as websites
    - VPN: Provides connectivity between remote hosts and business sites, between business sites, or between business sites and cloud networks
- High Availability and Scaling: _Avoiding single points of failure_
  - **Redundancy** to prevent outages.
  - **Availability Zones** are fault tolerant and unlikely to fail simultaneously.
  - Single point failure causes:
    - A server with one power supply
    - A server with one NIC
    - A single server hosting a website
    - A single server hosting a database
    - A single backup job stored on one piece of media
    - A single copy of a critical document
    - A single router or switch providing connectivity to a segment
- High Availability and Scaling in Scalability: _Auto-Scaling_
  - **Automatic scaling** of resources(VMs) to match work load.
- High Availability and Scaling in Scalability: _Horizontal scaling_
  - **Scaling additional instances(Adding VMs)** to meet the workload. Also known as scaling out.
- High Availability and Scaling in Scalability: _Vertical scaling_
  - **Upgrading|Adding** additional compute to **existing** instances.
- High Availability and Scaling in Scalability: _Cloud bursting_
  - **Redirecting on-premises traffic**(ex.. to cloud) when current resources are at 100% utilization.
