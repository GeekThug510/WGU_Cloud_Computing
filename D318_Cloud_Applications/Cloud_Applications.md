## 1.1 Compare and contrast the different types of cloud models.

- Public Cloud
  - A public cloud is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a third-party provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Users can access these resources over the internet and pay for them on a pay-as-you-go basis.
- Private Cloud
  - A private cloud is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure and services are dedicated to a single organization. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or in a colocation facility.
- Hybrid Cloud
  - A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds. This allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both models, such as the scalability and elasticity of public clouds and the security and control of private clouds.
- Community Cloud
  - A community cloud is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure and services are shared by a group of organizations with common interests or needs.
- Cloud within a Cloud
  - A cloud within a cloud is a cloud computing model where resources are provisioned from a public cloud provider but are then isolated and managed as a private cloud.
- Multicloud
  - Multicloud is the practice of using multiple cloud computing services from different providers. This can help organizations avoid vendor lock-in and take advantage of the best features and services from each provider.
- Multitenancy
  - Multitenancy is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure and services are shared by multiple organizations. This allows the provider to provide economies of scale and reduce the cost for users.
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - IaaS provides users with on-demand access to virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users have full control over the operating system, applications, and data that run on these resources.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - PaaS provides users with a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications. Users do not have to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure, such as servers and storage.
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - SaaS provides users with access to applications that are hosted and managed by the provider. Users typically access these applications through a web browser or mobile app.
- Internet of Things (IoT)
  - IoT is the network of physical devices that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, which allows them to collect and exchange data.
- Serverless
  - Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the **provider manages** the servers and infrastructure that run applications. Users simply write the code and the provider takes care of the rest.
- Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  - Machine learning and artificial intelligence are technologies that allow computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.
- Shared Responsibility Model
  - The shared responsibility model is a cloud computing model where the provider and the user share responsibility for security and compliance. The provider is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, while the user is responsible for securing their own data and applications.
