## 1.1 Describe cloud concepts (25â€“30%): Describe cloud computing

- **Define cloud computing**
  - on-demand network access to a shared pool that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort.
  - Microsoft: delivery of computing services over the internet. IoT, AI, ML,
- **Describe the shared responsibility model**
  - customer responsibility vs CSP(Cloud Service Provider).
  - Cloud infrastructure is more secure because company can shift focus on security and not on maintaining hardware.
  - [shared responsibility model](img/shared-responsibility-model.png)
- **Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid. Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model**
  - **cloud models**: cost-effective, global, secure, scalable, elastic(dynamic scaling), always current(do not have to worry about infrastructure, software patches, upgrades or other IT management task.)
  - **Public**: shared hardware between clients. scalability, agility, PAYG(pay-as-you-go), no maintenance, low skill(to get started).
  - **Private**: your responsible for entire stack. legacy support, control, compliance.
  - **Hybrid**: blend on-prem and Cloud. flexibility.
  - **Community**: infrastructure shared between multiple organizations with common needs.
  - [microsoft cloud model](img/microsoft_cloud_model.PNG)

  - Load balancing increases **availability and resiliency**.
  - distribute traffic evenly among each system in a pool.
  - user entry point. internal or external traffic routing to VMs.
  - You define forwarding rules, microsoft does the maintenance.
- **Azure Load Balancing: Application Gateway**
  - load balancer and WAF designed for HTTP traffic. OSI Layer 7 aware.
  - Cookie affinity, SSL termination, WAF(web application firewall), URL rule-based routes, rewrite HTTP headers.
- **Azure Load Balancing: Traffic Manager**
  - DNS based traffic load balancer.
  - Country routing to specific regions.
- **Azure Load Balancing: Bandwidth vs Latency**
  - Bandwidth: amount of data that can fit on the connection(size of pipe).
  - Latency: time to travel the network.
- **Azure Load Balancing: Load Balancer vs Traffic Manager**
  - Load Balancer: distribute traffic same region. Detects unresponsive VMs.
  - Traffic Manager: distribute traffic to preferred endpoint across regions. Detects unresponsive endpoints.

## O7_Azure_Security: Blueprints, Encryption, Defender For Identity, IAM, Policy, SDL

- **Blueprints**
  - declarative way to adhere to security or compliance requirements.
  - automate role assignments, policy assignments...
- **Encryption**
  - process of making data unreadable and readable. Secret key is used to encrypt/decrypt.
- **Encryption: Asymmetric**
  - slowest. public private key pair. allows for the sharing of secret key over insecure channel.
- **Encryption: Azure Storage Service**
  - automatically encrypts data before persisting it to service(Disk, Blob, Files, Queue...).
- **Encryption: Azure Disk**
  - windows and linux VM machine encryption.
- **Encryption: Azure Key Vault**
  - secure secrets(passwords...), keys, and certificate storage.
- **Encryption: Rest/Transport**
  - data at rest and in transit should be encrypted.
- **Encryption: Symmetric**
  - fastest. Secret key must be known by both parties.
- **Encryption: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**
  - database encryption by default.
- **Defender For Identity**
  - formerly known as Azure ATP(advanced threat protection).
  - cloud based solution to detect, identify, and investigate threats.
  - can be integrated with on-premises Microsoft Defender ATP.
- **Defender For Identity: Sensor**
  - monitor network traffic directly.
- **IAM**
  - identity and access management. Old way was physical security on-prem, doesn't work with cloud computing. IAM is role based authentication and privileges.
- **IAM: Azure AD**
  - Active Directory: manage IAM, MFA(multi factor authentication) and SSO(Single Sign On).
- **IAM: AAA**
  - Authentication: you are who you say you are.
  - Authorization: can access resource.
  - Accountability: every change written to logs.
- **IAM: Identity and Principal/Service Principal**
  - identity: a thing that can be authenticated. e.g. username and password. application w/ secret key.
  - principal: identity using roles. e.g. running `sudo` to elevate privileges.
  - service principal: application using roles to perform task.
- **IAM: RBAC**
  - role based access control. control over permissions to CRUD(create, read, update, delete).
  - granted to people and applications.
- **IAM: RBAC Roles**
  - owner, user access administrator, contributor, reader.
  - Global Administrator: full control.
- **IAM: AD PIM**
  - Privileged Identity Management: control of auditing, assigning and removing roles.
- **Policy**
  - ensure standards are followed in all IT departments.
  - GUI allows review of compliance across organization.
  - Create with JSON object.
- **Policy Scope**
  - what resource/group is assigned policy.
- **Security: Azure Information Protection (AIP)**
  - protecting sensitive documents with labels for automatic encryption.
- **Security: Azure ExpressRoute**
  - dedicated private connection between your network and Azure. extend on-premises to microsoft cloud.
- **Security: Application Security**
  - clean code free from vulnerabilities. Secrets secure. Security in application development life cycle.
- **Security: Azure Defender**
  - threat detection, monitoring, port control.
- **Security: CIA**
  - confidentiality, integrity, availability. Data is what attackers are after. Keep data encrypted, being changed by non-authorized person and available when needed.
- **Security: Compute Security**
  - avoid rogue VMs(abandoned, non-patched, non-secure).
- **Security: Defense in Depth**
  - micro segmentation designed to slow attack penetration. each segment is protected.
- **Security: DDOS**
  - distributed denial of service attack. every Azure region has DDOS prevention services.
  - **Basic**:
    - Automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform.
    - Always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level
    - Used by Microsoft's online services use.
  - **Standard**:
    - Tuned specifically to Microsoft Azure Virtual Network resources
    - Requires no application changes.
    - Dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms.
    - Policies are applied to public IP addresses associated with resources deployed in virtual networks
      - e.g. Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway.
    - Mitigates:
      - **Volumetric attacks**: The attackers goal is to flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic.
      - **Protocol attacks**: Render a target inaccessible, by exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack.
      - **Resource (application) layer attacks**: Target web application packets to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts.
- **Security: Incident Response Stages**
  - detect: notified threat was detected.
  - assess: look into suspicious activity.
  - diagnose: identify.
  - stabilize: containment, mitigation and workaround.
  - close: record in threat log.

  - control for which Apps can run.
- **Security: Security Policy**
  - rules that are enforced to enhanced security.
- **Security: Shared Responsibility Model**
  - who gets blamed when something goes wrong.
  - physical security: microsoft

- **SDL**
  - Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle. best practices used internally at Microsoft, for secure development.
  - Training: everyone is responsible for securing environment.
  - Requirements: security, internal standards and legal requirements, needs are updated continuously.

  - DAST (dynamic analysis security testing): perform prebuilt attack checking.
  - penetration testing
  - establish standards for incident response process.
- **SDL Threat Modeling**
  - hypothetical scenarios to help secure system data.
  - 5 steps: define, diagram, identify, mitigate, validate.

## 08_Monitoring, Health, Cost, Best Practices
