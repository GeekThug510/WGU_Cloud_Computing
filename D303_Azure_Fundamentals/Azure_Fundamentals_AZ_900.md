## 01_Cloud Basics

- **agility**
  - is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
- **Cloud Benefits**
  - **economies of scale**: cloud provider purchase large quantities of hardware at discount and pass on savings.
  - **CapEx to OpEx**: CapEx is hard assets(IT equipment). OpEx is operating expenses(monthly subscription).
  - **scalability & elasticity**:
  - **high availability & fault tolerance**:
- **Cloud Service Models: IaaS, Paas, SaaS**

  - ![cloud service models](./img/shared-responsibility.png)
  - **IaaS**
    - (Infrastructure as a Service). bare bones server with virtualization OS (AWS).
  - **PaaS**
    - (Platform as a Service). When you need to build software to meet your needs (They provide database, middleware..., look for more than Iaas).
  - **SaaS**
    - (Software as a Service). Complete solution, you just bring the data (office 365).

  | Platform | Cloud Provider Includes                                     |
  | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | IaaS     | physical hardware + hardware management software            |
  | PaaS     | IaaS + OS + app development environment(java, python, node) |
  | SaaS     | PaaS + complete app. You bring your data                    |

- **Consumption Based/Pay-As-You-Go Model**
  - only pay for what you use.
  - no upfront infrastructure costs.
  - enables better pricing prediction.
- **Containers**

  - highly portable. agile start/stop. application and dependencies are packaged in container.
  - **Docker**: open source container solution.
- **Current**
  - do not have to worry about infrastructure, software patches, upgrades or other IT management task.

  - is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters.
  - Cloud based backup services, data replication and geo distribution ensure confidence that your data is safe even if a disaster should occur.
- **elasticity**
  - is the ability to scale **dynamically**(autoscaling).
- **FMA**
