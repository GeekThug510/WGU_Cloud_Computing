- **Access Control Schemes**:

  - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access control based on attributes such as user roles, attributes, and environmental factors.
  - **Role-Based Access Control**: Access control based on user roles and permissions.
  - **Rule-Based Access Control**: Access control based on predefined rules and policies.
  - **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**: Access control based on security labels and policies.
  - **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Access control where owners of objects control access to them.
  - **Conditional Access**: Access control based on specific conditions or criteria.
  - **Privileged Access Management**: Managing and controlling privileged user access.
  - **Filesystem Permissions**: Permissions governing access to files and directories on a filesystem.

- **Order of volatility**

  1. Registers, Cache.
  2. RAM: Routing Table, ARP Cache, Process Table, Kernel Stastics, Memory.
  3. Temporary File Systems.
  4. Disk.
  5. Remote Logging and Monitoring Data that is Relevant to the System in Question.
  6. Physical Configuration, Network Topology.
  7. Archival Media.

- **Six Incident Response Process Steps**: 1. Prepare. 2. Identify. 3. Contain. 4. Eradicate. 5. Recover. 6. Lessons learned. (mnemonic Penguins In Cute Earmuffs Riding Lemons).

- **Key Frameworks**:
- **Center for Internet Security (CIS)**: Provides a set of best practices and guidelines for securing systems and data. CIS Controls and CIS Benchmarks are well-known resources in the cybersecurity community.
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)/Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: NIST provides comprehensive guidance on risk management and cybersecurity practices. The NIST CSF is widely adopted as a framework for improving cybersecurity posture.
- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001/27002/27701/31000**: ISO 27001 is a globally recognized standard for information security management systems (ISMS). ISO 27002 provides guidelines for implementing controls. ISO 27701 extends privacy management to ISO 27001. ISO 31000 is a standard for risk management.
- **SSAE SOC 2 Type I/II**: These are auditing standards developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) for service organizations to demonstrate their controls and security practices. SOC 2 Type II is more rigorous and involves testing controls over a period.
- **Cloud Security Alliance**: An organization that promotes best practices for secure cloud computing. Their Cloud Control Matrix provides a framework for assessing cloud security.
