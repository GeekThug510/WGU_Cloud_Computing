- **customer**
  - The role that defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.
- **service**
  - A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
  - The customer does not want to worry about how the service gets to them. customer doesn't care how the company manages risk, compliance..., they just want the service.
- **service management**
  - A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services.
  - Anything that distinguish's the company(culture, products, people).
- **sponsor**
  - The role that authorizes budget for service consumption. Can also be used to describe an organization or individual that provides financial or other support for an initiative.
- **user**
  - The role that uses services.
- **utility**
  - The functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. Utility can be summarized as ‘what the service does’ and can be used to determine whether a service is ‘fit for purpose’. To have utility, a service must either support the performance of the consumer or remove constraints from the consumer. Many services do both.
- **warranty**
  - Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. Warranty can be summarized as ‘how the service performs’ and can be used to determine whether a service is ‘fit for use’. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. This may be based on a formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image. Warranty typically addresses such areas as the availability of the service, its capacity, levels of security, and continuity. A service may be said to provide acceptable assurance, or ‘warranty’, if all defined and agreed conditions are met.
