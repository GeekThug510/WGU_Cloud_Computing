- What does blockchain implement to ensure reliable data are returned when there are multiple sensors measuring the same data? % A. Mega-merger method % B. Agreed consensus mechanism % C. Shared storage quorum % D. Byzantine Paxos algorithm
  - **Correct Answer**
    - **Agreed consensus mechanism**: Blockchain technology utilizes a consensus mechanism to ensure all participating nodes in the network agree on the validity of a transaction (adding a new data block). This consensus mechanism ensures that even if some sensors might report slightly different readings due to factors like calibration or environment, only one version of the data is accepted and added to the blockchain. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). These mechanisms incentivize nodes to verify and agree on the data, promoting data integrity and preventing manipulation.
  - **Incorrect Answer**
    - **Mega-merger method**: There's no standard method called **mega-merger** in blockchain technology. It's likely not a relevant term in this context.
    - **Shared storage quorum**: While blockchains involve distributed storage across nodes, **shared storage quorum** isn't a widely used concept. Consensus mechanisms play a more prominent role in ensuring reliable data.
    - **Byzantine Paxos algorithm**: Byzantine Paxos is a complex consensus algorithm used in some distributed systems, but it's not the most common approach in public blockchains. Agreed consensus mechanisms like PoW or PoS are more widely implemented.
- Which blockchain feature in an IoT application ensures that a transaction is tamperproof once it is validated? % A. Decentralization % B. Immutability % C. Auditability % D. Resilience
  - **Correct Answer**
    - **Immutability**: Immutability is a core feature of blockchain technology. Once a transaction is validated and added to a block, the block becomes part of a tamperproof chain. Any attempt to alter the data within a block would require modifying all subsequent blocks, which becomes increasingly difficult as the chain grows longer. This immutability safeguards the integrity and authenticity of transactions within the IoT application.
  - **Incorrect Answer**
    - **Decentralization**: Decentralization distributes data storage and ledger maintenance across a network of nodes. While it contributes to security, it's not the specific feature that guarantees immutability of individual transactions.
    - **Auditability**: Blockchain transactions are auditable, meaning anyone can view the history of transactions. However, auditability itself doesn't prevent tampering.
    - **Resilience**: Blockchain networks are resilient to failures or attacks due to their decentralized nature. While resilience is a valuable feature, it doesn't directly address immutability of individual transactions.
- What is the purpose of the consensus mechanism enabled through blockchain when collecting the same signals from multiple IoT sensors? % A. Ensuring that data from each sensor is treated equally % B. Providing a single version of the truth across all sensor data % C. Identifying a single sensor with the most accurate data % D. Verifying data from sensors by a central authority
  - **Correct Answer**
    - **Providing a single version of the truth across all sensor data**: In an IoT application where multiple sensors collect the same data, there might be slight variations in readings due to factors like sensor calibration or environmental conditions. The consensus mechanism within the blockchain ensures that all participating nodes in the network agree on a single version of the data to be added to the blockchain. This agreement helps establish a verifiable and tamperproof record of the sensor data, eliminating discrepancies and providing a single source of truth.
  - **Incorrect Answer**
    - **Ensuring that data from each sensor is treated equally**: While the consensus mechanism promotes fairness within the network, its primary purpose isn't to give equal weight to every sensor's data point (which might have slight variations). It focuses on agreeing on a single, verifiable data record.
    - **Identifying a single sensor with the most accurate data**: The consensus mechanism doesn't determine which sensor is **most accurate.** It validates the data and reaches an agreement on a single version to be recorded. Data analysis techniques might be used later to assess sensor accuracy based on specific criteria.
    - **Verifying data from sensors by a central authority**: Blockchain is inherently decentralized, meaning there's no central authority verifying data. The consensus mechanism involves distributed verification among multiple nodes within the network.
