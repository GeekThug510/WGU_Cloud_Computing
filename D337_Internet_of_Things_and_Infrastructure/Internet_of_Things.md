  - I'd say **study the PA extensively** as the OA is very similar with some questions verbatim.
  - Just study the **bolded terms** in the book and the **acronyms**, the other half of the exam is literally common sense.
  - LowPowerWAN "LPWAN" there were like 3-6 questions on that alone, make sure you know your regs and what they do like NIST, ICT, etc.
  - The most important part of the book was the last 4 chapters, the ones that talked about IoT in transportation, healthcare, agriculture (specifically the difference between sensors, actuators, etc), and the ethical concerns and standards behind IoT. Those 4 chapters make up at least 50% of the exam.
  - few questions about **botnets** and the **Mirai Malware**.
  - The only thing they really want you to know is that the **malware specifically attacks devices with default credentials**.
  - They hit Blockchain pretty hard in the OA too so I'd study up on how a blockchain operates, but if you've taken the Intro to Crypto course before this you will have no problem in that section.
