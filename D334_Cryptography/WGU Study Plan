I finally passed the Intro to Cryptography course, and it only took me 2 days of focused effort. Here’s a breakdown of what worked for me:
Resources Used
Professor Wolf's YouTube Course:
Watched all 45 videos (skipped assessment ones) in 3-4 hours and took detailed notes.
For anything unclear, I asked ChatGPT for examples since the professor goes through videos fast.
Shawn's C839v5_D334 All_in-One_Study Guide:
Memorized tables (bit sizes, block sizes, rounds, etc.) by rewriting them 5-10 times. This took about 2 hours but made the exam much easier.
Plan
Day 1: Watched videos, took notes, and memorized tables.
Day 2: Reviewed notes, rewrote tables, passed the pre-assessment, and took the exam.
Exam Experience
My proctor didn’t show up at first, so I wasted 30 minutes with their support team, and they didn't help. Thankfully, I was able to reschedule for next 30 minutes.
The exam was straightforward—lots of memorization around encryption types, bit/block sizes, and when to use them. READ QUESTIONS CAREFULLY. Took me 25-30 minutes to complete and pass!
